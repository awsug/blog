AWS Landing Zone helps quickly set up a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices thus help save time by automating the set-up of an environment for running secure and scalable workloads while implementing an initial security baseline through the creation of core accounts and resources.

It also uses the most up-to-date Node.js runtime.
