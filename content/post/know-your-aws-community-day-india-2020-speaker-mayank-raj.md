Cron jobs are used everywhere i.e. from scripts that run the data pipelines to the automated cleanup of the development machine, from cleaning up unused resources in the cloud to sending email notifications that will be run using AWS Lambdaâ€”a serverless computing service that abstracts away machine management and provides a simple interface for task automation.

AWS Lambda with its pay-per-use model, pay for the compute time used by the Lambda applications. For short-lived tasks, this can generate significant savings. Also get metrics, anomaly detection, and easy-to-use secrets management right out of the box.

Tune into the session!
