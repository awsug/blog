Amazon Aurora Global Database replicates the data with no impact on database performance, enables fast local reads with low latency in each region, and provides disaster recovery from region-wide outages. Global Database uses storage-based replication with a typical latency of less than 1 second, using dedicated infrastructure that leaves the database fully available to serve application workloads. One of the secondary regions can be promoted to read and write capabilities in less than 1-minute in the unlikely event of a regional degradation or outage,
