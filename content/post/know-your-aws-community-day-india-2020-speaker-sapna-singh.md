The AWS Lambda is a serverless computing platform that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. AWS Lambda is designed for use cases such as image or object uploads to Amazon S3, updates to DynamoDB tables, responding to website clicks or reacting to sensor readings from an IoT connected device. AWS Lambda can also be used to automatically provision back-end services triggered by custom HTTP requests, and "spin down" such services when not in use, to save resources

With Lambda, running code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration is possible. Just upload the code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale the code with high availability. Set up the code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

Tune into the session!
