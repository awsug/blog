Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code. It runs on many Unix-like systems and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. It works against multiple systems in the infrastructure by selecting portions of Ansibleâ€™s inventory, stored as edit-able, version-able ASCII text files. Ansible orchestrates a node by installing and running modules on the node temporarily via SSH and uses an agentless architecture.

Tune into the session!
